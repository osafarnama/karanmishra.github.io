I am a Junior Researcher at the EU Tax Observatory hosted at Paris School of Economics. I am broadly interested in public economics, political economy, and the role of technology.

I hold a BA (Hons.) Economics from University of Delhi and a MRes Economics (APE) from the Paris School of Economics. I have previously worked with Centre for Equity Studies, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, and the Royal Economic Society.
I love to observe, listen, read and write; sometimes in that order, mostly simultaneously.
